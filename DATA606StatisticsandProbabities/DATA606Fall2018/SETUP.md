#### Announcements

Welcome to DATA606! My name is Dr. Jason Bryer and I will be your instructor for this semester. In addition to teaching this course, I am an Executive Director at Excelsior College where I am currently working on a Department of Education grant to develop a Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (see www.DAACS.net for more information). Couple of important notes as you get started:

* The course syllabus is on Github here: data606.net I will post all course materials there. Blackboard will be used primarily for communicating with one another vis-Ã -vis the discussion boards and to submit assignments.
* Introduce yourself in the Getting Acquainted forum on Blackboard.
* Once you go through the syllabus, try starting Lab 0 as soon as you can. This will require you to install R and RStudio and will help get you get acquainted with R.
* The best way to reach me is by email at jason.bryer@gmail.com. If you would prefer to talk on the phone or setup a GoToMeeting session, it is best to suggest some times by email first.
* Our meetups will be on Wednesdays from 8pm to 9pm.
* I am looking forward to getting to know everyone and a fantastic semester! Good luck!
