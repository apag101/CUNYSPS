* Authored over a dozen R packages including:
	* [likert](http://github.com/jbryer/likert)
	* [sqlutils](http://github.com/jbryer/sqlutils)
	* [timeline](http://github.com/jbryer/timeline)
* Specialize in propensity score methods. Three new methods/R packages developed include:
	* [multilevelPSA](http://github.com/jbryer/multilevelPSA)
	* [TriMatch](http://github.com/jbryer/TriMatch)
	* [PSAboot](http://github.com/jbryer/PSAboot)

* Final exam (18%)
* [Meetup Presentation](http://data606.net/assignments/presentation/) (5%)

## The `DATA606` R Package

The package can be installed from Github using the `devtools` package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('jbryer/DATA606')
```

### Important Functions

* `library('DATA606')` - Load the package
* `vignette(package='DATA606')` - Lists vignettes in the DATA606 package
* `vignette('os3')` - Loads a PDF of the OpenIntro Statistics book
* `data(package='DATA606')` - Lists data available in the package
* `getLabs()` - Returns a list of the available labs
* `viewLab('Lab0')` - Opens Lab0 in the default web browser
* `startLab('Lab0')` - Starts Lab0 (copies to getwd()), opens the Rmd file
* `shiny_demo()` - Lists available Shiny apps

## Using R Markdown

R Markdown files are provided for all the labs. You can start a lab using the `DATA606::startLab` function.

However, creating new R Markdown files in RStudio can be done by clicking `File` > `New File` > `R Markdown`.
