      <description>Welcome to DATA606! My name is Dr.Â Jason Bryer and I will be your instructor for this semester.

      <description>To get started with the labs, you will need to install R and other supporting applications. Links to download all the software is on the Software page at http://data606.net/software which is available on the Misc menu. Once you are in RStudio, you will need to install a number of R packages using the following two commands:
install.packages(c(&amp;#39;openintro&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;OIdata&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;devtools&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;ggplot2&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;psych&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;reshape2&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;knitr&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;markdown&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;shiny&amp;#39;)) devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;jbryer/DATA606&amp;quot;) Note that this course used to be listed as IS 606, hence the different package name.</description>
