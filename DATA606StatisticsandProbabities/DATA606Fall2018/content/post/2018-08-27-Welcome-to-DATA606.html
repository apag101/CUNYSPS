<p>Welcome to DATA606! My name is Dr.Â Jason Bryer and I will be your instructor for this semester. In addition to teaching this course, I am an Executive Director at <a href="http://excelsior.edu">Excelsior College</a> where I am currently working on a Department of Education grant to develop a Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (see <a href="http://www.daacs.net">www.DAACS.net</a> for more information). Our first meeting will be on Wednesday, September 5th. Couple of important notes as you get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>The course syllabus is on Github here: <a href="http://data606.net">data606.net</a> I will post all course materials there. Blackboard will be used primarily for submitting assignments.</li>
<li>Introduce yourself in the Getting Acquainted forum on Blackboard.</li>
<li>Once you go through the syllabus, try starting Lab 0 as soon as you can. This will require you to install R and RStudioand will help get you get acquainted with R.</li>
<li>The best way to reach me is by email at <a href="mailto:jason.bryer@gmail.com">jason.bryer@gmail.com</a>. If you would prefer to talk on the phone or setup a GoToMeeting session, it is best to suggest some times by email first.</li>
<li>Our meetups will be on Wednesday from 8pm to 9pm.</li>
<li>I am looking forward to getting to know everyone and a fantastic semester! Good luck!</li>
