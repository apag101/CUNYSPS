8.1 Baby weights, Part I. The Child Health and Development Studies investigate a range of topics. One study considered all pregnancies between 1960 and 1967 among women in the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in the San Francisco East Bay area. Here, we study the relationship between smoking and weight of the baby. The variable smoke is coded 1 if the mother is a smoker, and 0 if not. The summary table below shows the results of a linear regression model for predicting the average birth weight of babies, measured in ounces, based on the smoking status of
the mother.

(a) Write the equation of the regression line.

(b) Interpret the slope in this context, and calculate the predicted birth weight of babies born to smoker and non-smoker mothers.

(c) Is there a statistically significant relationship between the average birth weight and smoking?



Slide With Code
========================================================
- We use the Confidence interval for the difference between the 2 Proportions which in this case:

    - POr - PCa +or- z * Sqrt(Por(1-PCa)/POr + PCa(1-POr)/PCa)

- We are 95% confident that the difference between proportion of sleep deprived residents Of California as compare to residents of Oregon will fall between a 0, 2%
