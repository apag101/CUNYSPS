 What odds should a person give in favor of the following events?
(a) A card chosen at random from a 52-card deck is an ace. (b) Two heads will turn up when a coin is tossed twice. (c) Boxcars (two sixes) will turn up when two dice are rolled.

```{r}
a <-round(4/52, 4) * 100 

b<-round (1/2 * 1/2, 4) * 100

c<-round (1/6 * 1/6, 4) * 100

```

a) As there are 4 aces in a deck of cards the probabily of chosing an ace is `r a`%

b) The probabilty that 2 heads will turn up when a coin is tossed twice is `r b`%

c) The probabilty boxcars will turn up when two dice are rolled is `r c`%
