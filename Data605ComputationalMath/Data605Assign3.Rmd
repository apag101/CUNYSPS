(1) What is the rank of the matrix A?
A =

 1 2 3 4
-????1 0 1 3
 0 1 -????2 1
 5 4 ????-2 ????3

```{r}

```
(2) Given an mxn matrix where m > n, what can be the maximum rank? The mini-
mum rank, assuming that the matrix is non-zero?

```{r}

```

(3) What is the rank of matrix B?
B =

1 2 1
3 6 3
2 4 2

```{r}

```

Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A. You'll need to show your
work. You'll need to write out the characteristic polynomial and show your solution.

A =

1 2 3
0 4 5
0 0 6

```{r}

```
