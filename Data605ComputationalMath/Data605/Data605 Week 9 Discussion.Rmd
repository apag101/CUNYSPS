13 A noodle machine in Spumoni's spaghetti factory makes about 5 percent defective
noodles even when properly adjusted. The noodles are then packed
in crates containing 1900 noodles each. A crate is examined and found to
contain 115 defective noodles. What is the approximate probability of finding
at least this many defective noodles if the machine is properly adjusted?


```{r}
n<- 1900
p<- .05
q<- .95
x<- 115
np <- n * p
npq <- sqrt(n*p*q)
xx<- (x - np)/npq/npq
```

**The approximate probability of finding at least 115 defective noodles is `r round(xx, 2)`**
