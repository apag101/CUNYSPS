10. A boat is being pulled into a dock at a constant rate of
30/min by a winch located 10 above the deck of the
boat. At what rate is the boat approaching the dock when the
boat is:

```{r}
ratep <-function (b)
{
    a <-30
    c <- sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
    t <-10
    p<-round((c*(c/t)-a*(a/t))/b,2)
    p
}
```


(a) 50 feet out

**`r ratep(50)` feet per minute**

(b) 15 feet out?

**`r ratep(15)` feet per minute**

(c) 1 foot from the dock

**`r ratep(1)` feet per minute**

(d) What happens when the length of rope pulling in the
boat is less than 10 feet long?

**At less than 10 feet long it will go less than 3 feet/min**
