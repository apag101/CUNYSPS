Using R, build a  regression model for data that interests you.  Conduct residual analysis.  Was the linear model appropriate? Why or why not?

```{r}
data("attitude")
summary(attitude)
c.lm<-lm(attitude$rating~attitude$complaints)
plot(c.lm)
```

$\color{red}{\text{QQPlot drops off the line towards end so it is nearly linear}}$
