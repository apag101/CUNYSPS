## Exercise 1.4

Both QQ Plots show that Salary and Expenditure are positively correlated with Total SAT scores

```{r cars}
#1.4
data(sat, package="faraway")

qqplot(sat$salary, sat$total)
qqplot(sat$expend, sat$total)

```



When combining expenditure with Salary with Expendity, Salary seems to be more correlated based on the lower tvalue.

```{r }
lm1<-lm(sat$total ~sat$expend+sat$salary)
summary(lm1)

```

GGPLOT shows a combination of salary and expenditure is also strongly correlated with total SAT scores.

```{r}
ggplot(data= sat) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = lm1$residuals, y = total, size= total), stat = "identity", position = "identity")+
    theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=9))
```
