This article discusses how some companies are using data analytics to improve operational performances. It discusses how companies that are investing in data analytics are reaping benefits in market returns and are 4 times more likley to be respected in their industry.. Their transformation was to use ther research technology for 2 years on 480 large organizations and they found there was a large gap in the haves and have nots.

In one example, they have found that by using analytics top performing companies have discovered that retaining top performers by giving them higher raises, would help retain these employees. They infer that retaining top performers is a key to a top performing company. Without any addtional information the article states that top performers out deliver mid-level performers by a wide margins. This statenment is unreliable since a wide margin means different things to different people. If i were making this argument i would back it up with real numbers, specific performance metrics in different industries and campare top level performers to mid level performers. This data will help justify the evidence and counter my rebuttal on that statement.
