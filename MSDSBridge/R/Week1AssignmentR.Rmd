## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


###AUTHOR : ANTHONY PAGAN
###Write a loop that calculates a 12 Factorial
```
fac <- 1
for (i in 12:1){
    if(i >0)
    {
       fac <- fac * i
     
    }
    }
    print(fac)
```

###Show how to create a numeric vector that contains the sequence from 20 to 50 by 5
```
fives <- seq(20,50,5)
fives
```

###Create the function "factorial" that takes a trio of input numbers a, b, c and solve the quadratic equation. The function should print as output the 2 solutions
```
factorial <- function(){
    a.num<- readline(prompt = "Enter A variable of quadratic equation: ")
    b.num<- readline(prompt = "Enter B variable of quadratic equation: ")
    c.num<- readline(prompt = "Enter C variable of quadratic equation: ")
    
    a.num <- as.integer(a.num)
    b.num <- as.integer(b.num)
    c.num <- as.integer(c.num)
    
    factp <- (- b.num + sqrt(b.num ^ 2 - 4 * a.num * c.num)) / 2 * a.num
    factm <- (- b.num - sqrt(b.num ^ 2 - 4 * a.num * c.num)) / 2 * a.num
    
    sprintf ("X values are %s and %s", factp, factm)
    
}
```
